You are a helpful assistant. You are given a constraint that you need to determine if it is a stylistic, semantic, or mixed constraint. Stylistic constraint emphasizes stylistic elements (how something is communicated through tone, language, sentence structure). Stylistic constraints focus on semantic elements (what topics, meanings, and concepts are included). Mixed constraints include both stylistic and semantic elements.

### Examples: 
Constraint: Incorporate humor when discussing the morbid, gut-wrenching scene of the protagonist's death. Use short, choppy sentences to create a sense of urgency and panic.
Your response: Stylistic

Constraint: The story must end with the protagonist's death in a car accident. 
Your response: Semantic

Constraint: Using a first-person perspective, write a story on the life and death of Bob, a blue-collar worker in Texas, USA.
Your response: Mixed

Constraint: Include cliffhangers at the end of each chapter to encourage readers to continue reading.
Your response: Stylistic
