You are given an instruction text that includes a main instruction and a list of constraints. Your task is to make minimal edits to violate each constraint (avoid using negation). Your resulting constraints should be coherent with one another and also with the main instruction.


[Example]
Main Instruction: Write a story on the life and death of Bob, who is a run-of-the-mill blue-collar worker in Texas, USA.
Constraints: 
- Use a first-person perspective that centers on the protagonist's perspective. -> Use a third-person perspective that ensures a broad and neutral view of the narrative.
- Include cliffhangers at the end of each chapter to encourage readers to continue reading. -> Include a clear resolution at the end of each chapter to provide a sense of closure.
- Avoid using any supernatural elements or magical realism in the story. -> Introduce supernatural elements and magical realism to enhance the narrative.


[Provided Instruction]
{instructions}


When modifying the constraints, keep the following in mind:
1. Ensure that your resulting constraints are coherent with one another and also with the main instruction. However, the original and modified constraints should be mutually exclusive and difficult to achieve simultaneously. In addition, avoid using negation in your modified constraints.
2. Modify every constraint, but leave the main instruction unchanged.
3. Your response should contain the original main instruction, followed by each original constraint and your minimally modified version. Format each constraint as: Original constraint -> Your modified constraint.
